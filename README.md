<b>Common Lisp Implementation of the PCG Random Number Generator</b>

cl-pcg is a common lisp implementation of the PCG random number generator as described at the <a href=http://www.pcg-random.org> PCG website</a>.  It is essentially a direct port of the <a href=http://www.pcg-random.org/download.html>minimal C implementation</a>.  It has been tested under SBCL and Lispworks.  cl-pcg allows you to specify your random state.
